# Basic info
Script runs by default at 127.0.0.1 port 5000. Using nginx or lighttpd,
it's fairly simple to point a domain name and port 80 or 443 at the
server.

Modify settings.py setting "name" to set the name of your board;

# Help! My board is broken!
Resetting / initializing a board is fairly simple,
but is not possible from the script yet. Begin by
clearing out the directory `./threads/boardname/`
where boardname is either `local` or some remote board
that is named in the settings file.

In the `./threads/` directory:

1. Make a new directory, `boardname/0/`
2. Create `boardname/0/head.txt`
3. Enter `Hello world`, newline, `none`
4. Create `boardname/0/boardname.txt`
5. Enter `0<>none<>none`
6. Create `boardname/0/list.txt`
7. Enter `boardname 0`
8. `python3`
9. `import refresh`
10. `refresh.mkboard(boardname)`

Removing files from ./archive/ which contain `boardname`
(e.g. `rm ./archive/*boardname*` ) may also be useful.
