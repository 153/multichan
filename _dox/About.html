<h1> What is Multichan? </h1>

Multichan is a federated, tag-based textboard server.
It is public domain software available here:<br>
&emsp; &emsp; <a href="https://bitbucket.org/796f/multichan">
  https://bitbucket.org/796f/multichan</a>
<br>meaning you can download the software, modify it any way you want,
and share it or run it however you wish. You can view a live version
of multichan at <a href="https://0chan.vip">https://0chan.vip</a> .
<p>
The name is a reference to 2channel, named originally for being the
``second channel'' of a popular anonymous textboard in Japan. It was the
successor to a site called Amezou, which was a popular anonymous
messageboard. People could use their computers to share ideas and
communicate completely independently of their offline identity. This
resulted in Amezou becoming very popular; 2channel was meant to help
support the Amezou by remaining online when the other site ran out of
bandwidth or otherwise went offline. It grew to become the largest web
bulliten board for many years.
<p>
Multichan extends on this idea of a plurality of servers by employing
federation, where all servers can back each other up, creating an system
of networked discussions. A Multichan server will faithfully copy
discussions and responses from other Multichan servers which are in its
friends list. In this way, the network can be understood as simply a
collection of messages from users, while various websites offer
different views of this network based on the personal biases of
independent server operators. A server can offer either a very open 
view of the community, or a more limited one; this experiment will
yield interesting results.

Clients can create a discussion topic, reply to a discussion, view a
discussion, or get a list of discussions. Discussions can be assigned a
tag. A list of tags, or a list of threads under a tag, or a list of
threads from multiple tags can be viewed. 
<p>
Servers share discussions with each other, too. So, what does this all
mean? Discussions can be held in a server-agnostic fashion. The
server-agnostic nature of a discussion means that unpopular moderation
decisions will possibly punish a server by reducing its userbase;
in time, servers with the least amount of moderation will become the
most popular, followed by ones that filter out just spam and trolling,
followed by ones that restrict the tag list / heavily filter new threads
and responses, etc.
<p>
The multichan server can also be used to make your own personal backups
of the network, even if you don't plan to host a website yourself. In
the future, more tools will be released to do things with this database.

<h2> Textboard software </h2>

Defining characteristics of textboard software can best be understood by
comparing them with ``typical" forums.
<p>
Textboards: <ul>
<li> <b>Do not require registration.</b>
<br> Most web messageboards require, at the very least, a username,
     email address, and a password in order to make posts. A downside
     of this is that registration is generally annoying, and it can 
     constrain a user's freedom to share thoughts because account-based
     systems lead to the development of personas. The value inherent to
     a position can be overlooked when the reputation of the speaker is
     necessarily attached. Binding messages to their poster's identity
     can also lead people to play games where personas are pitted against
     each other or become the focus of discussion themselves, which does
     not generally enhance conversations. Finally, registration can be a 
     security risk -- emails or passwords can be leaked, or usernames 
     can become the object of cyber-stalking. 
<li> <b>Focus on text, rather than images or video.</b>
<br> If the purpose of a messageboard can be stated simply, it is to 
     provide a space for conversations to take place. Sometimes, 
     embedding images can clarify a message. At other times, they are
     used to stop dialog or provide no value to the conversation, 
     especially in the form of memes. In some mediums (such as Facebook, 
     Twitter) recycled images and video substitute discussion entirely. 
     There is little incentive to post time-wasting / irrelevant media
     in a text-only forum. Indeed, better software exists for social 
     media sharing -- Danbooru, Pleroma, etc.
<li> <b>Sort conversations by active participation.</b>
<br> For websites that focus on breaking news or new multimedia, 
     recent activity is not a good sort metric. But for general 
     discussion-based websites, it does fine. Novelty is not the 
     defining quality of most discussion topics; indeed, a conversation
     should be able to continue for days, weeks, or months, if it 
     continues to be relevant to people.
<li> <b>Do not have expiration dates for discussion topics.</b>
<br> In line with the previous point, conversations on textboards 
     generally take place over days, weeks, or even years. This is in
     contrast especially with imageboards (on 4chan, conversations 
     generally do not persist for over 24 hours) but also Reddit, 
     Facebook, or even Twitter, where the focus is on discussions 
     started recently, generally within the last week.
<li> <b>Bore boring people.</b>
<br> Because textboards are generally adverse to low-effort 
     contributions (especially media recycling) and encourage
     anonymity, there is little incentive for boring people to stick
     around a textboard. 
<li> <b>Are easy to setup and modify.</b>
<br> The majority of textboard software rejects the use of SQL servers,
     favoring flatfile databases. Because the read and write operations
     on the data is simple, and the data itself is simple, extending or 
     altering basic functions becomes very easy. All that's historically 
     been needed to run a textboard is a domain name and CGI-capable 
     server. Multichan simplifies the installation process further by 
     including its own webserver, which makes setup as simple as 
     downloading the software and then running the included script. 
</ul>

<h2> Tags' superiority to ``boards" </h2>

For over 20 years, 2ch (and in turn 4chan, 8chan, etc) have depended on
the concept of a board to organize threads. These are based on the idea
of a newsgroup, which is over 35 years old (stemming from USENET). 2ch's
system of boards essentially categorize every conversation under a single
label, such as breaking news, psychology, soft drinks, childcare, Trump,
sumo, etc etc. The shift from newsgroups to boards is a downside in that
USENET groups offer a clear hierarchy: eg, <code>alt.tv.talkshows.daytime</code>
is more specific than <code>alt.tv.talkshows</code> which is more specific
than <code>alt.tv</code>.
<p>
2ch tried to address the limitation of a ``board" (simple index of 
conversations) by simply creating as many boards as possible. There are
several hundred 2ch boards in existence today. Essentially running
hundreds of isolated websites for one community is not pragmatic for
administration; for readers and commenters, it's only ideal if the user
is interested in a limited number of topics.
<p>
When one or more topics apply to a conversation, there are two simple
remedies on simple board based websites. One is cross-posting: the
same conversation is copied to (ex) 3 or 4 places, then 3 or 4 different
conversations are taking place based on the same topic message. The
second is multi-board browsing (ex) multiple boards have their
conversations pooled together into one meta-board. This is problematic
because it still leads to duplicate threads as a result of cross-posting
(repeating the same thread in multiple boards to make it visible to more
people) The only real solution to actually implement tagging, which
means that the same exact conversations exist in multiple places. This
best serves the purpose of a board or directory in the first place:
narrowing the global index of conversations based on a theme.
<p>
2ch and 4chan, unlike 8chan, never added the ability to make new boards,
or to view multiple boards at the same time. Multichan goes a step
further than 8chan by eliminating boards while making a vast number of 
tags available. A topic with multiple categories will still be listed in
these multiple indexes, but if they're viewed together, the topic will
only be listed once, as it should.

<h2>Why Federation is the future</h2>
2ch and 4chan have traditionally viewed other servers in the anonymous
board network with hostility; this anti-social attitude unfortunately
means that their staff members have to manage too many boards and too
many users, instead of spreading responsibility. To see how to community
tries to address this limitation, let's look at imageboard
directories. <a href="https://www.allchans.org/"> 
This one</a> (allchans.org) lists about 30 imageboard servers, each of
which hosts 10-50 boards on average.
<p>
iichan was the first board that tried to address the problem of running
many boards: different site owners volunteered to run some boards, and
all sites would link to each other, creating a network with many boards
operated independently by multiple server operators. <br>
Lynxchan/Vichan are starting to address the problem in a sophisticated
way by sorting links across the network to other boards by info like
``posts per hour", users, and last activity.
<p>
NNTPchan realized that sharing threads between servers solves one
problem of imageboards: the same board exists in many places, but each
board only exists in one; this fractures the userbase. With NNTPchan,
the more servers that exist, the stronger and more unified the network
is. 
<p>
Archive boards and ghost boards, such as <a href="http://warosu.org/">
warosu.org</a> add more nuance to how text and imageboards on one site
respond to those on others. Warosu (fuuka) not only creates a 1:1
duplication of certain 4chan conversations; it also provides its own
commenting system for its users to make replies on 4chan conversations
from Warosu's servers; the creation of Warosu was primarily a response
to 4chan's overzealous post-removing philosophy. Warosu makes all
comments available, while users decide for themselves what they want to
see. This is the archive board. The ghost board is the comments from
Warosu users themselves, which 4chan never sees.
<p>
Once meta-board and meta-site browsing is common, along with board
archival, federation becomes the next obvious step. While overboards,
webrings, and archives try to promote equality between servers and
boards, proper federation goes a step further by eliminating the
difference. Federation links and archives boards by acknowledging
that remote archives will receive comments that may be relevant to the
original discussion at hand.

<h2> Influences </h2>

The influences upon multichan are numerous:
<ul>
  <li> <a href="http://2ch.sc">2channel</a> -- the original anonymous
       textboard website.
  <li> <a href="http://1chan.us">1chan.us</a> -- uses tags, rather than
       boards, to organize threads.     
  <li> <a href="https://www.wired.com/2012/07/wiki-inventor/">Federated
       Wiki</a> -- the creator of the wiki came to believe federation
       could solve the problems of users and administrators alike by
       overcoming the limitations imposed by any single server / central
       authority.
  <li> <a href="https://github.com/majestrate/nntpchan">nntpchan</a> --
       decentralized (federated) imageboard software. Formerly known as
       <i>overchan</i>.
