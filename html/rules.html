<div style="text-align: justify;">
We have a few simple rules on this board to make this experiment fun.
<p>
  <b>One.</b>
  Do not spam, make posts exessively, post hate speech, post hateful content,
  or post links to illegal or offensive content.
  The reason for this rule is that violations not only make this server
  less fun for its members, but because bad posts will also infect other
  servers.
<p>
  <b>Two.</b> 
  Try to partake in thoughtful or interesting discussion. This can be things
  like discussion of current events, books, or even things like your random
  thoughts. Controversial discussions are allowed as long as you try to be
  respectful.
<p>
  <b>Three.</b>
  Do not post NSFW image links unless the thread has an NSFW tag. The
  future handling of NSFW content will be resolved if it becomes a
  problem. Extreme content will be removed at moderator's discretion.
  <p>
  Emergency reports can be made in #multich @ freenode / #multich @ libera,
  #0chan @ rizon, or #multich:privacytools.io .
