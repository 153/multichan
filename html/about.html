<div style="text-align: justify">
<b>multich</b>, or <i>multiple channels</i><sup>[1]</sup>, is a novel
decentralized platform for conversations. Unlike other social media platforms,
<b>a)</b> registration is not necessary to participate in conversation;
<b>b)</b> the conversations are not "owned" or controlled by any single
entity; <b>c)</b> manipulative algorithms and annoying advertisements
are not included in the software.
<p>
People wishing to participamate in the greater community can connect to any
website running our software that is choosing to participate in our
<b>decentralization</b> features. Simply put, our conversations are shared
between any computers that want to help keep the discussion going.
Connecting to one website will let you see conversations from other websites,
and posting your messages to one website triggers a domino effect that pushes
your messages to other websites.
<p>
This <b>decentralization</b> might sound like an unusual concept to base a
chat software around, but the author of the software thinks that it's worth
investigating because it eliminates many of the problems associated with
running group chats in an elegant way. Anyone with a desktop computer is able
to grow the network, making censorship more difficult. <p> Decentralizing a
network also reduces the overall cost of maintaining the platform. If you
choose to help run the network with us, you likely won't even see your electric
bill increase; you can also manage the content on your server entirely as you
like. Be warned, however, that unpopular moderation decisions might drive users
away from your server, or influence other server operators to ignore output
from your server, limiting the outreach of content your users provide.

website that has some features that resemble those in multich.
