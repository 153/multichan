1604803366<>Anonymous<>Today, I began actually implementing federation features. In the " refresh " module, I added "pullboard" function that looks at the threads created by a remote board, and if there are new threads or threads that have new replies on the originating board, the updated files are pulled over and integrated. <br><br>This is the first step toward real federation; it could be considered archiving or mirroring. <br><br>Two boards that follow each other can share their threads with each other, but not their comments on the other board's threads. <br><br>syncthread() is intended to pull all remote replies to a given thread (eg, once board A downloads board B's thread, it can also see board C and D's remarks on it) and syncboard() will attempt to pull all foreign comments from friends on the threads of a given board into the local database.
